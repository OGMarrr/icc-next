        <p>The Blue Hawks recovered from being rattled to put out a 93-57 win against the Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP) Radicals in the NCRAA Season 29 men's basketball tournament on Thursday, April 13, at the PUP Gym, Sta. Mesa, Manila.</p>

        <p>Jake Gaspay registered a performance of 17 points on top of four rebounds for the Blue Hawks, including his defensive stops against the Radicals.</p>

<p>The Blue Hawks had to dig deep to find themselves and maintain their successive standings as they were down by nine in the early first quarter. The Blue Hawks worked hard to cut down the lead of the Radicals by one, 18-17, to close the first quarter.</p>

<p>Going to the second quarter, the team found it difficult to make a shot against the defensive Radicals, but after Gaspay's re-entery, the Blue Hawks came to their senses, which led to a blistering 15-2 run in the efforts of Alfred Flores and Serafin Duarte's two-pointers to pull themselves within six, 38-32.</p>

<p>The Blue Hawks continued their momentum as they dominated the Radicals in the third quarter with a score of 64-43.</p>

<p>Entering the fourth quarter, the Radicals tried to get a run, but Gaspay's three-pointer stopped it immediately, and it gave way for the Blue Hawks to regain the momentum and dominate the last quarter of the game with the ending score of 93-57.</p>

<p>In the final seconds of the second quarter, Serafin Duarte lost his balance and fell to the ground. As of this writing, the Herald team was trying to find out more about Duarte's condition. We hope for a quick recovery and a less serious injury.</p>

<p>The Blue Hawks' next game will be against the PATTS College of Aeronautics Sea Horses on April 17 at the PUP Gym, Sta. Mesa, Manila.

<p>When asked about the performance of the team, Coach Mortega stated, "The ICC kids are very competitive. In their matches, they almost don't want to lose to look like they won a gold medal even though there are times when they really can't, and you can see it in the kids who really love what they're doing; they don't stop even though they know it's very difficult."</p>

<p>We are eagerly awaiting this team's performance in their forthcoming matches.</p>

<p>The team regularly trains at the ICC gym every Saturday and Sunday at 11:00 am to 1:00 pm. Intesrested students are welcome to join.</p>

<p>All the best, Blue Hawks! Congratulations!</p>
